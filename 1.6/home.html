        <h2>The story of Me</h2>
        <p>
            Ever since I could walk, gaming has occupied most of my free time and for the last 10 years I’ve begun pursuing it as my career.<br>
            Game art, programming and HCI are my main passions and I strive to always better myself.<br>
            The most effective way for me to learn is working in structured groups but I’m just as comfortable working individually. <br>
            I consider myself a “curious gamer” as I’ve made a habit of playing most newly released titles, regardless of genre, and completing about half of them. <br>
            Studying game development has truly changed the experience of gaming for me, making me analyze mechanics and assets as I play. <br>
            I feel that my diverse gaming experience helps me create more player-friendly features and assets.<br>
