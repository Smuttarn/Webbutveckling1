        <h2>What's to come?</h2>
        <p>
            I think I'm a person who generally prefers knowing over not knowing something. But when it comes to the future I'm a bit torn.<br>
            While I value predictability, it can also make the experience less interesting and exciting. I love being surprised and learning new information.<br>
            Knowing beforehand or being too invested in one particular path, it sort of removes what I think is fun in life. <br>
            I often reflect upon events and choices from the perspective that my universe is one of infinitely many. <br>
            Every version of my actions is happening, it's up to me to choose the one that leads to my prefered outcome. <br>
            It's a difficult thing to explain, but enough existential philosophy for now.<br><br>

            That being said, I do have some <i>goals</i> I'd like to achieve in life. <br>
            I want to know a lot about code and how to manipulate machines. I intend to stay humble and adapt to new technology as I get older. <br>
            I wish to preserve my active physical lifestyle and to never lose the will to learn further. <br>
            I'd like to somehow contribute to the improvement of human life, both locally and globally. <br>
            Such so that when I'm done living, I'd like for all my good deeds to have far outweighed the bad. <br>
            If the consequenses of me existing (however small they may be) has had a positive effect on the world, then I am more than content. <br><br>

            Most of all I hope to be happy and to be surrounded by good people.
