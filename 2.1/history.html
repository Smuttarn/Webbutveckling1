            <h2>The story so far</h2>
            <p>
                Early one Friday <time datetime="04:00">morning</time> in <time datetime="1994-09-09">1994</time>, a child was born. <br>
                'Twas me.<br> <br>
                Swedish became my third language, thanks to my Finnish mother and Chilean father. I am very thankful of my upbringing and what my parents did for us. <br>
                My sister and I were encouraged to pursue happiness in our lives, while showing acceptance and respect towards others. <br>
                Our household always had laughter as a main ingredient, which I try to bring with me wherever I go. <br> <br>
                Through kindergarten to high-school I had trouble knowing what I would want to do with my life. No subject felt particularly interesting for me to want to pursue. <br>
                The only constant thing was my fascination for languages. Later during the course of my education I took a liking to learning and comparing them. <br>
                I began exploring languages with roots in Latin, in which Spanish helped med immensely and the learning process was facilitated thanks to similarities in grammar. <br>
                I reflected upon how I was getting used to the process of <i>learning</i> a new language. I'd break it up into steps and exposed myself to situations in which I'd be forced to try and speak.<br>
                It was during my time attempting to learn Mandarin that I began thinking of other types of languages, mainly those that were used to communicate with machines...

                Yo tuve un hermano,<br>
                no nos vimos nunca <br>
                pero no importaba.<br><br>
                Yo tuve un hermano<br>
                que iba port los montes<br>
                mientras yo dormía.<br>
                Lo quise a mi modo,<br>
                le tomé su voz<br>
                libre como el agua, <br>
                caminé de ratos<br>
                cerca de su sombra.<br><br>

                mi hermano despierto<br>
                mientras yo dormía,<br>
                mi hermano mostrándome<br>
                detrás de la noche<br>
                su estrella elegida.
