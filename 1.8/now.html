        <h2>Nothing like the present</h2>
        <p>
            Today I study computer science at a great university with even greater schoolmates. <br>
            My appartement is a mere trainstation away where I live with my beautiful girlfriend whom I've been together with since 2013. <br>
            She makes me smile with everything she does and truly is my best friend. I could go on forever about her so it's probably best if I stop now. <br><br>

            I am particularly interested in efficient algorithms and datastructures, aswell as anything that has to do with databases or data warehousing. <br>
            The pure aspect of problem-solving is what most intrigues me about programming. Even more interesting is the fact that most problems that arise within programming <br>
            are errors in the programmers way of thinking, not the machine. Therefore I often practice logical reasoning and I enjoy playing sudoko daily.<br>
            Troubleshooting and testing has been a big part of my studies and I look forward to putting my skills to the test and improving in a working environment. <br>
            My vision for my code is for it to be readable, structured and well-documented, making it easily accessible for anyone who works on it as well as for future self.<br><br>

            Apart from such logical games I am also an avid gamer. It's a hobby that has occupied most of my freetime during life and that's nothing I intend to change anytime soon.<br>
            I consider myself a “curious gamer” as I’ve made a habit of playing most newly released titles, regardless of genre, and completing well over half of them. <br>
            Studying game development has truly changed the experience of gaming for me, making me analyze mechanics and assets as I play. <br>
            I feel that my diverse gaming experience helps me create more player-friendly features and assets.<br>
