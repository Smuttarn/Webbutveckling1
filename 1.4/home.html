        <h2>The story of Me</h2>
        <pre>
            Ever since I could walk, gaming has occupied most of my free time and for the last 10 years I’ve begun pursuing it as my career.
            Game art, programming and HCI are my main passions and I strive to always better myself.
            The most effective way for me to learn is working in structured groups but I’m just as comfortable working individually. 
            I consider myself a “curious gamer” as I’ve made a habit of playing most newly released titles, regardless of genre, and completing about half of them. 
            Studying game development has truly changed the experience of gaming for me, making me analyze mechanics and assets as I play. 
            I feel that my diverse gaming experience helps me create more player-friendly features and assets.
