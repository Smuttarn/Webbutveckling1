        <h1>"Video Killed the Radio Star"</h1>
        <p>"Video Killed the Radio Star" is a song written by Trevor Horn, Geoff Downes and Bruce Woolley in 1978. It was first recorded by Bruce Woolley and the Camera Club (with Thomas Dolby on keyboards) for their album English Garden. <br>
            A more widely known version of the song was recorded later by British new wave/synth-pop group the Buggles, which consisted of Horn and Downes. <br>
            The Buggles' version of the track was recorded and mixed in 1979, released as their debut single on 7 September 1979 by Island Records, and included on their first album The Age of Plastic. <br>
            The backing track was recorded at Virgin's Town House in West London, and mixing and vocal recording was done at Sarm East Studios.
            The song relates to concerns about, and mixed attitudes towards 20th-century inventions and machines for the media arts. Musically, the song performs like an extended jingle and the composition plays in the key of D-flat major in common time at a tempo of 132 beats per minute. <br>
            The track has been positively received, with reviewers praising its unusual musical pop elements. <br>
            Although the song includes several common pop characteristics and six basic chords are used in its structure, Downes and writer Timothy Warner described the piece as musically complicated, due to its use of suspended and minor ninth chords for enhancement that gave the song a "slightly different feel."</p>
