        <h2>Nothing like the present</h2>
        <p>
            Today I study computer science at a great university with even greater schoolmates. <br>
            My appartement is a mere trainstation away where I live with my beautiful girlfriend whom I've been together with since 2013. <br>
            She makes me smile with everything she does and is truly my best friend. I could go on forever about her so it's probably best if I stop now. <br>
            I am particularly interested in efficient algorithms and datastructures, aswell as everything that has to do with databases or data warehousing. <br>
